based on https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf


for execution you will need NASM, QEMU an MinGW added to Path
done, that's just run Compile and Run.bat

QEMU: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/
MinGW: http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/binaries/MinGW/mingw-get-inst-20110530.exe

DONE:

-print to screen
-clear screen
